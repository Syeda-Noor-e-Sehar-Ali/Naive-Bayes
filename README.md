# Naive-Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming feature independence.It calculates the probability of each class given the data using conditional probabilities. For prediction, it selects the class with the highest probability as the predicted class for new data. Naive Bayes is efficient for large datasets due to its simplicity and works well with categorical and numerical data, making it widely used in text classification and spam filtering tasks.
